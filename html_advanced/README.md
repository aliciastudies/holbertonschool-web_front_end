# Learning Objectives

### Guidelines for HTML
Use proper indentation and semantic HTML tags, provide alt text for images, and ensure valid and accessible code.

### Creating the skeleton of an HTML5 page
Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to declare HTML5, then use `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Inside `<head>`, include a `<title>` for the page title.

### Using semantic HTML tags
Semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>` help structure your content for search engines and assistive technologies.

### Use cases for div vs. span
`<div>` is a block-level element for grouping content, while `<span>` is an inline element for applying styles or scripting to a part of text or content.

### Semantic values of HTML tags
- `<header>`: Represents a container for introductory content, typically containing a logo and a site title.
- `<main>`: Contains the central content of the document.
- `<footer>`: Represents a container for the footer of a section or the document.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition, like a news article or blog post.
- `<nav>`: Contains navigation links.
- `<section>`: Groups related content together.
- `<aside>`: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it.

### Using headings
Use headings (h1 to h6) to create a hierarchical structure for your content. It's important to follow the order (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to maintain a logical and accessible content structure.

### Making lists in HTML
Use `<ul>` for unordered (bulleted) lists and `<ol>` for ordered (numbered) lists. List items are marked with `<li>`.

### Differences between media types (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG)
- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics for vector images, logos, and icons.
- GIF: Graphics Interchange Format for simple animations or images with transparency.
- PNG: Portable Network Graphics for images with transparency and sharp edges.
- JPG (or JPEG): Joint Photographic Experts Group for photographs and images with gradients.

### Structuring data in a table
Use the `<table>` element with `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers, and `<td>` for table data cells. Tables are ideal for presenting structured data.

### Integrating a video
Use the `<video>` element to embed videos. Specify the video source with the `src` attribute and include controls for play, pause, and volume.

### Integrating an audio file
Similar to video, use the `<audio>` element to embed audio. Include the source with the `src` attribute and controls for playback.

### Embedding external content
Embed content from external sources using `<iframe>`.

### Structuring an HTML page
Start with an HTML5 template, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>` with metadata, and `<body>`. Organize your content using semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
