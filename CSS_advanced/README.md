# Learning Objectives

### Selectors, properties, and values
Selectors target which elements to style. Properties are characteristics like colour or font size. Values are what properties are set to like red or 16px.

### Difference between block and inline styling
Block-level elements take up the full width of their container and start on a new line. Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and don't start on a new line. Styles can be changed using CSS.

### Ensuring consistency across browsers (CSS reset)
To ensure the website looks the same on different browsers, a CSS reset can be used. It helps remove default styles and makes the styles more consistent.

### Setting up CSS variables
CSS variables allows values to be stored and reused in styles. Use the `--variable-name` notation, and reference using `var(--variable-name)`.

### Differences between inline, embedded, and external CSS
Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element, embedded CSS is in a `<style>` tag within the HTML file, and external CSS is in a separate .css file. They have different use cases and priorities.

### How grid systems work (with floats)
Grid systems help organize page layouts. Floats were used for this, but now CSS Grid and Flexbox are also options for creating grid layouts.

### Difference between icons webfonts and SVG icons
Icon webfonts use fonts to display icons, while SVG icons use scalable vector graphics. SVG icons are more flexible and accessible.

### Difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state (like :hover), while pseudo-elements style specific parts of an element (like ::before to add content before an element).

### Making background gradients
Create background gradients using the `background-image` property in CSS. Define the type (linear or radial) and colours to create smooth transitions.

### Animating elements in CSS
Animate elements by using CSS properties like `transition` or `keyframes` animations. Define what to animate and the duration of the animation.

### Transforming (2D, 3D) elements
`transform` changes the position, size, and rotation of elements. Transform in 2D (like scaling or rotating) or 3D (adding depth).

### Vendor prefixes
Vendor prefixes are short codes added to CSS properties to make them work in specific web browsers. They help ensure compatibility with older and newer browser versions. For example, `-webkit-` for Chrome and Safari, `-moz-` for Firefox.
